Important notes:

This code uses example datasets (PRIDE: PXD000561, GEO: GSE68719) which may not be specific to NDEs. For a real analysis, you'd need to find and use datasets specifically related to neuron-derived exosomes.
The proteomics data processing is simplified. In a real scenario, you'd need more sophisticated preprocessing and analysis of mass spectrometry data.
The RNA-seq data processing assumes a certain format of the GEO series matrix file. You might need to adjust the parsing depending on the specific dataset you use.
The feature selection part uses randomly generated labels for demonstration. In a real analysis, you'd need proper labeling of your samples.
You may need to handle missing values, normalize the data, and perform other preprocessing steps depending on the specific datasets you use.

To find relevant NDE datasets:

Search PRIDE (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/) for "neuron-derived exosome" or related terms.
Search GEO (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) for RNA-seq data related to neuron-derived exosomes.

Once you find appropriate datasets, replace the pride_id and geo_id in the code with the relevant identifiers.

===================
exosome_comparison_analysis.py

This script will:

Retrieve protein lists from ExoCarta and Vesiclepedia.
Compare your PD-NDsEV proteins with these databases.
Identify proteins that are:

Known exosomal proteins (found in ExoCarta and/or Vesiclepedia)
Potentially novel exosomal proteins (unique to your dataset)


Generate a Venn diagram to visualize the overlap between datasets.
Provide statistics and a scatter plot for the potentially novel exosomal proteins.

After running this analysis, you'll have:

A clear understanding of how many of your identified proteins are known exosomal proteins.
A list of potentially novel exosomal proteins for further investigation.
Insights into the characteristics (probability, coverage, peptide count) of these novel proteins.

This information will help validate your findings and highlight potential new discoveries in exosome research, particularly in the context of Parkinson's Disease.
